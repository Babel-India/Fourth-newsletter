            <div className='poem'>
               <p className='poem-line'>Video games are often dismissed as unsophisticated or the domain of couch potatoes, but did you know that many common elements of these simulated worlds can provide tangible benefits in real life? Benefits of video games for both children and adults include:</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>1. VIDEO GAMES ARE PRODUCING BETTER SURGEONS.
                While you may think you want your surgeon reading up on the latest medical research instead of playing games, you might want to reconsider: a study of laparoscopic (small incision) specialists found that those who played for more than three hours per week made 32 percent fewer errors during practice procedures compared to their non-gaming counterparts.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>2. VIDEO GAMES COULD HELP PEOPLE OVERCOME DYSLEXIA.
                Some research points to attention difficulties as being a key component of dyslexia. One study has shown dyslexics improved their reading comprehension following sessions of games heavy on action. The reason, researchers believe, is that the games have constantly changing environments that require intense focus.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>3. VIDEO GAMES COULD IMPROVE YOUR VISION.
                “Don’t sit too close to the television” used to be a common parental refrain without a lot of science to back it up. Instead, scientists are discovering games in moderation may actually improve—not strain—your vision. In one study, 10 weeks of play was associated with a greater ability to discern between different shades of grey.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>4. VIDEO GAMES COULD HELP MAKE YOU A BETTER LEADER.
                Because certain genres of games reward and encourage leadership traits—providing for “communities,” securing their safety, etc.—researchers have noted that players can display a correlating motivation in their real-world career goals. Improvising in a game can also translate into being faster on your feet when an office crisis crops up.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>5. VIDEO GAMES CAN MAKE KIDS MORE ACTIVE.
                While some games promote a whole-body level of interaction, even those requiring a simple handheld controller can lead to physical activity. Sports games that involve basketball, tennis, or even skateboarding can lead to children practicing those same skills outdoors.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>6. VIDEO GAMES MIGHT SLOW DOWN THE AGING PROCESS.
                So-called “brain games” involving problem-solving, memory, and puzzle components have been shown to have a positive benefit on older players. In one study, just 10 hours of play led to increased cognitive functioning in participants 50 and older—improvement that lasted for several years.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>7. VIDEO GAMES CAN HELP YOU MAKE NEW SOCIAL CONNECTIONS.
                Gamers are sometimes stigmatized as being too insulated, but the opposite is actually true. The rise of multi-player experiences online has given way to a new form of socializing in which players work together to solve problems. But studies have shown games can also be the catalyst for friends to gather in person: roughly 70 percent of all players play with friends at least some of the time.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>8. VIDEO GAMES CAN HELP ADDRESS AUTISM
                Gamers using systems that incorporate the entire body to control onscreen movement have been shown to be more engaged in celebrating victories with their peers, which runs counter to the lack of communication people with autism sometimes present. A study also showed that sharing space with multiple players can also lead to increased social interaction for those with the disorder.</p>
