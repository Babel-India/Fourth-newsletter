               <p className='poem-line'>In the era of technology, 
               we see generations showing keen interest in the gaming world,
                and we see everyone playing them around us in some way or the other. 
                Everyone finds it interesting, and all age groups are involved, 
                but very few notice how much time, effort, patience and perseverance is required 
                to build such popular and irreplaceable games that are created with utmost precision.
                These popular games are played on platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch.
                </p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Currently, games like League of Legends, Fortnite, 
                  Grand Theft Auto, Counter-Strike,etc. are celebrated games and are so popular that live streams
                  of these games are watched on Youtube by millions. 
                  These games took three to five years to complete, whereas mobile games like BGMI,
                  FreeFire, etc. were developed in a few months. The length of development is influenced by a
                  number of factors, such as genre, scale, development platform and number of assets. 
                  The development of a complete game usually involves a team of 20â€“100 individuals with 
                  various responsibilities, including designers, artists, programmers, and testers. 
                  The game goes through various phases and is created through collaboration between 
                  studios who work together religiously and faithfully.
                </p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Mainstream commercial PC and console games are generally
                developed in phases: first comes pre-production, then pitches, prototypes,
                and then game design documents are written. If the idea is approved, and the 
                developer receives funding, then full-scale development begins. Sometimes failing to 
                provide clear implications of the game's expectations may result in exceeding the allocated budget. 
                The game industry requires innovations, as publishers cannot profit from the constant release of 
                repetitive sequels and imitations. Every year new independent development companies open and some 
                manage to develop hit titles.
                </p>
               <p className='poem-line'>No one actually sees Behind The Scenes of the gaming industry and gets an 
               insight into it and only sees the outlook that is design and graphics, its genre and storyline of the 
               game and decides on that basis if the game is worth playing and whether to make it go viral or not. 
               The gaming industry is a huge world in itself, and exploring it is a memorable experience, 
               and everyone should for once explore it by being a part of it.
